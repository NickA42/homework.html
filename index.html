  Chapter 7
  </h1>
  <h2>
  In this chapter, there was a lot of talk about statistic stuff and how to use it for your advantage when looking at different types of graphs. Cairo wrote about the standard deviation (which is the square root of the variance), z-score (or standard score), how a smaller scale of data tends to show more variation, different types of graphs created and a raw score.
